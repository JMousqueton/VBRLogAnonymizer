> __A tool to anonimyze your Veeam logs__


VeeamLogAnonymizeris is a C# program designed for anonymizing log files generated by [Veeam](https://www.veeam.com) Backup & Replication v12,  which may contain sensitive information like server names, IP addresses, email addresses, and more. Anonymizing log files helps protect privacy and confidentiality when sharing or analyzing these logs.

I want to clarify that I'm not a developer by profession, but rather a member of the Veeam community who saw the need for a tool like this. The script has been created out of a passion for data privacy and a desire to contribute to our community.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclamer 

This script is still as an early stage of development. 

‚ö†Ô∏è UNDER CONSTRUCTION ‚ö†Ô∏è

I want to make it clear that I am not employed by or associated with Veeam Software in any official capacity. This script, its development, and its distribution are entirely independent efforts. It is not endorsed or supported by Veeam Software.

The script has been created by a member of the Veeam community out of a genuine interest in data privacy and the needs of fellow users. While it is designed to work with Veeam Backup & Replication logs, it is not an official Veeam product, and any issues or concerns related to its use should be directed to me rather than Veeam Software.

Please use this script responsibly and in accordance with your organization's policies and any relevant data privacy regulations. Always ensure that you have proper backups and safeguards in place when making changes to log files.

Thank you for understanding the independent nature of this project.
